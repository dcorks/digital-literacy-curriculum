| Hemingway Editor [Hemingwayapp.com](http://Hemingwayapp.com) |  Gives suggestions to make your writing more simple and direct, similar to the style of [Ernest Hemingway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway#Writing_style) | If you’re concerned that your writing is too convoluted and difficult to understand. Hemingway’s style isn’t the best for all situations, but it’s good for things like reports and slides (and journalism), where clear communication is more important than emotional impact. |
