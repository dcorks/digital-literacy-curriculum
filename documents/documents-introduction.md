# Documents - learning module

[TOC]

## Importance

Documents are important (and will never go away) because they are how we remember information and ideas. We think about ideas and discuss them with other people, and then we formalize them by writing them down. Quick, simple ideas become a memo or note on your phone. Ideas about what already happened become reports. Ideas about what to do in the future become official plans. Ideas about what to do together are formalized as proposals, contracts, and agreements. Big, complex ideas get published as books and textbooks. Each of these human activities centres around writing text in a document.
In the modern world, and especially in professional contexts, we spend a lot of time reading documents and also a lot of time creating documents. Being able to do this effectively and efficiently is worth an investment of our time and effort.

## Warm-up questions

* How much time do you spend formatting your documents (compared to time spent actually writing them)?
* Does the design and formatting of a document make you more likely to trust its contents?
* Does a given document file look the same on every device?
* Do you have any preferred fonts?
