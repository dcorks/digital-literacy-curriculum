General questions for this week:

* What are the one or two most important things you learned (or unlearned or relearned) from this week’s readings, lecture or tasks?  
* What things from this week were unclear or confusing for you, or what questions do you still have about this week’s topic?

Theme questions for this week:

* When you wrote formal documents in the past (for school or work), how much time did you spend formatting those documents (compared to the amount of time you spent writing them)?  
* Do you pay attention to references? As a reader, do you look at references in books and news articles to check the source of the information? As a writer, do you tell your readers where all of the facts and ideas in your writing came from?

*You aren’t required to respond to these particular questions in your reflection. Check the guidelines about reflection assignments for more information.*

## Assignment

### Goal

Adapt an old, public domain text (that’s freely available as plain text) into a structured and well-formatted document.

### Basic requirements

* Pick an old text that is in the public domain (see notes below).  
  * Public domain texts are generally very easy to find online in plain text versions.  
  * You may not break any copyright laws when sourcing your text.  
* Create a well-formatted version of the text using a word processor.  
  * This version will be a .docx, .odt, or .pages file, or   
  * a link to a cloud-based word processing tool (Google Docs, MS 365, Naver Docs, Zoho Writer, etc.)  
* Create a PDF version of your document.  
* Rename both your document and your PDF file appropriately.   
* Submit both versions of your document  
  * We need your text in the format you used to create it so we can check the structure of the document and see how you made it.  
    * If you submit a cloud-based document, you need to give **commenting permissions** to “**anyone with the link**” so that we can see the structure of your document.  
  * We need your text as a PDF so we can see the appearance of your document as you intended it.  
* See the screenshot below for guides on how to insert links and attach files

### Grading criteria

Your end result should be a clean, well-formatted document.

**Basic requirements** \[6 points\]  
*Any errors in basic requirements results in 0 points for this rubric category.*  
**Structure** \[3 points\]  
*One point deducted for each mistake or missing requirement*

* Text is formatted using "styles", following the concepts of structured authoring.  
  * All formatting should be consistent.  
  * i.e. All text formatted with Heading 1 should look the same.  
* Document includes the following:  
  * Styles matching the following concepts and applied to the text: Title, subtitle, headings  
  * Table of contents (dynamically generated based on the headings in the document that you submit)  
  * Page numbers (inserted as header/footer)  
  * At least one image directly related to the text  
  * References, using an academic reference format such as APA style, MLA style, or Chicago style, for:  
    * The original text, including a link to where you found the text  
    * Any images you include

**Appearance** \[3 points\]  
*One point deducted for each instance of distracting, poorly chosen or inconsistent design*

* Document is visually appealing, is organized and easily readable, and is easy to visually parse  
* Document’s design is thematically appropriate for the chosen source text.  
* Document doesn’t use any default styles.  
  * In other words, change the appearance of all styles that you use.  
  * Everyone knows what the defaults look like and is very bored with them. Show us that you can make your own appealing design.

### Notes

If a work is in the ‘public domain’, that means its copyright has expired.

* Texts in the public domain are free for anyone to access, copy, modify, print, sell, etc.  
* In most countries, copyrighted works become public domain 50 years after the death of the author; in some countries the standard is 70 years after the death of the author.

The source text can be in any language.

* If the source is not in English, include English translations of the title and author's name as a subtitle, and write the academic reference in English. The rest of the document’s content can be in the source language.

If the original text is long, DON'T INCLUDE THE WHOLE TEXT.

* Your document shouldn’t be more than 1000 words.  
* Cut out parts of the original text as needed. Limit the content under each heading to two paragraphs at most. (See the document from Task 01 as a model of how to do this.)
